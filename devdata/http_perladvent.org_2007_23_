<H2 align=center>Dickens also rates an 8</H2>
<H3 align=center>by Jerrad Pierce</H3>

<P>It's a little known fact that before he took over operations at the North
Pole Santa was working on his M.B.A. As jolly as the old elf is, he's a real
stickler for standards and metrics. Needless to say, the Winter Solstice B&amp;E
cookie muncher was thrilled when <tt><a href="../../2005/19/">Test::Perl::Critic</a></tt> was covered
but that was sometime ago and he's beginning to long for something more&hellip;
enter <TT><A href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=B::Fathom">B::Fathom</A></TT>.
Fathom gathers some arcane statistics it employs in seemingly arbitrary
calculations to generate a value from <tt>0 .. 10</tt> or null to line noise.While the subroutine count seems off, the overall results are not unreasonable
as indicated below.
